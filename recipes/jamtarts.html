    <h2>Description
        <p>These are so simple to make that my 3-year-old daughter did most of the work. Make sure not to roll the pastry too thin, and don't put too much jam in.</p>
    </h2>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup shortening</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>Â½ cup water</li>
    <li>1 cup jam</li>
<h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, shortening, sugar, and salt together in a food processor until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add water and mix until a ball is formed. Refrigerate pastry until well chilled, at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 24 shallow muffin cups.</li>
        <li>Roll pastry out thin; cut into rounds with a cookie cutter. Place each round in a muffin cup. Add 2 teaspoons of jam to each cup.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool tarts on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
</ul>
